  <h1>Vowels</h1>
  <p>The current English alphabet only has 6 vowel characters, counting the occasional (yet common) Yy that literally just seems to copy Ii. However, stating that there are merely 5 vowels in English with just a short and long form, as often taught in early elementary education in the United States does a massive disservice to the true complexity of the system at play.</p>
  <p>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_vowel_chart_with_audio'>International Phonetic Alphabet vowel chart</a>, despite its arguably controversial origins and Eurocentrism, is evidently a terrific way to analyse sounds in English. One thing of note here for any unfamiliar is that this chart is by no means specific to English, and learning it along with its associated <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_consonant_chart_with_audio'>consonant chart counterpart</a> can be hugely beneficial in efforts to learn another language and reduce your foreign accent in speaking. English, like many other languages, also has a lot of diphthongs (combinations of multiple vowels) which will not be visible on the chart.</p>

  <p><small><sup>*</sup>Dialects with the cot-caught merger pronounce [ɒ] identically to [ɑ].)</small></p>
  <p>Despite English having this much variation in its vowel sounds, it would be impractical and overconvoluted to assign each one a letter, which would take 20 — the same number of letters we are usually taught are always consonantal! Additionally, not all of them have the same commonality within the language, with many more common than others.</p>
  <h2>Ambiguous &amp; Redundant Vowels</h2>
  <p>Back to the lists above, it's clear that [u] and [ʊ] are particularly hard to distinguish with <gm>oo</gm> representing both sounds. Thus, I deem here our first inductee to English orthography: the overdot, or just 'dot' for short, diacritic mark.</p>
  <p>In addition, doesn't it kind-of seem to be a waste of space to use a double Ee for the <ph>iː</ph> sound, not even going into sometimes-useless sometimes-pronounced digraphs like <gm>ea</gm> and <gm>oa</gm>?</p>
  <p>Furthermore from even that, it's sometimes ambiguous whether we are to use <ph>u</ph> or <ph>ju</ph> as the <q>long</q> form of the letter Uu. Might we fix that too?</p>
  <p>Henceforth I shall enact my first changes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The <ph>æ</ph> and <ph>ɑ</ph> sounds are often just written the same (<b>a</b>lly v.s. <b>a</b>ll), so the latter shall be distinguished as <b>Ȧȧ</b>.</p>
    <p>The <ph>iː</ph> sound currently represented by <gm>ee</gm> (<b>ee</b>l), <gm>ei/ie</gm>, and <gm>ea</gm> (<b>ea</b>t) shall now be spelt with an <b>Ėė</b>.</p>
    <p>The <ph>ʊ</ph> sound currently represented by <gm>oo</gm> (b<b>oo</b>k) and <gm>oul</gm> (c<b>oul</b>d), and often confusingly just <gm>u</gm> (p<b>u</b>t), shall now be spelt with an <b>Ȯȯ</b>.</p>
    <p>The letter <gm>u</gm> when in its <q>long</q> form shall be replaced (when it makes the sound <ph>ju</ph> as opposed to just <ph>u</ph>) with <b>U̇u̇</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <!--<p>Firstly, I would like to preface this with the removal of meaningless, largely-obscurely-still-pronounced double vowel characters: such as <gm>ea</gm> (outside of the <pm>iə</pm> sound as in <q>h<b>ea</b>r</q>) / <gm>ie/y/ey</gm> into <gm>ee</gm>, <gm>oa</gm> into <gm>o_e</gm> or <gm>oo</gm>, <gm>ir/ur</gm> into <gm>er</gm>, and whenever <gm>oo</gm> makes the <ph>u</ph> sound, into <gm>u_e</gm>.</p>-->
  <p>This allows us to rewrite "cool" as "cule", "put" as "pȯt", and "look" as "lȯk".</p>
  <p>The replacement for the phoneme isn't exclusive to just <gm>oo</gm> ― it also applies to things like the werd "full", which is now "fu̇ll", even in the suffix "-ful", which is now "-fu̇ll" for consistency ȧnd the sound identicality.</p>
  <p>In prȧctice, ȧdding a few more rules for consistencė and diȧmbiguitė wȯd bė of tremendous benefit:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The letter Yy is no longer a letter, now to be replaced with a form of Ėė or Ii.</p>
    <p>The <gm>oo</gm> combination left making the <ph>u</ph> sound shall become <b>u_e</b> (blank=consonant).</p>
    <p>The <gm>oa</gm> combination left making the <ph>o</ph> sound shall become <b>o_e</b>.</p>
    <p>In American English, <ph>ɚ</ph> will now ALWAYS bė written ȧs <b>er</b>, ȧs in <q>nerse</q>.</p>
    <p>Remove silent E's thȧt don't change werd pronunciations. Similarly remove otherwise ȧmbigu̇ous c's and g's at the end of words.</p>
    <p>Change Oo to Uu when it makes an <ph>u</ph> sound.</p>
    <p>The silent GH and Wr, let us remuve thȧt in entiretė (lite; frite; rong).</p>
    <p>Double intra-werd consonants ȧfter short vowels.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>A Stressful Perplexitė</h2>
  <p>What this vowel conundrum dusn't ėven du justis tu is how vowels ar often stressed or reduced (think pr<i>sent</i>ing a pitch tu yore boss versus recėving a <i>pre</i>sent. It is the verė addressing of this problem which shall bė mi next issu̇ed fix.</p><br/>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The majoritė of English werds hav werd-initial stress.</p>
    <p>The majoritė of unmarked Spanish werds hav werd-penultimate stress.</p>
    <p>And in irreguler stress cases, Spanish u̇ses the acu̇te ȧccent (´) going down tu up.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Whi not just adópt this intu Inglish? Thare cȧn alás bė a differens betwėn <i>contésting</i> yore victerė in thȧt <i>contest</i>. Bi default, wė cȧn assume thȧt stress is on the ferst sillable.</p>
  <p>Plus, whi must wė kėp riting long-unpronounced vowels ȧs in "choc<b>o</b>late"? Tern the "differens" intu a "difrens"!</p>
  <p>Why not just adópt this into English? There can alás be a difrence between <i>contésting</i> yore victerė in that <i>contest</i>. And of course, by defáult, stress will be on the initial syllable.</p>
